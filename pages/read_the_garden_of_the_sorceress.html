            The Garden Of The Sorceress
        </h1>

        <hr class="divider divider_1">

        <main>
            <p class="text">THERE were once a man and a woman who wished very much to have a little child. Now these people had
                a small window in their cottage which looked out into a beautiful garden full of the most lovely flowers and
                vegetables. There was a high wall round it, but even had there not been, no one would have ventured to enter the
                garden, because it belonged to a sorceress, whose power was so great that every one feared her.</p>
        
            <p class="text">One day the woman stood at the window looking into the garden, and she saw a bed which was planted
                full of most beautiful lettuces. As she looked at them, she began to wish she had some to eat, but she could not
                ask for them. Day after day her wish for these lettuces grew stronger, and the knowledge that she could not get
                them so worried her, that at last she became so pale and thin that her husband was quite alarmed. "What is the
                matter with you, dear wife ?" he asked one day</p>
        
            <p class="text">"Ah !" she said, " if I do not have some of that nice lettuce which grows in the garden behind our
                house, I feel that I shall die." The husband, who loved his wife dearly, said to himself, " Rather than my wife
                should die, I will get some of this lettuce for her, cost what it may."</p>
        
            <p class="text">So in the evening twilight he climbed over the wall into the garden of the witch, hastily gathered a
                handful of the lettuces , and brought them to his wife. She made it into a salad , and ate it with great
                eagerness.</p>
        
            <p class="text">It pleased her so much and tasted so good that after two or three days had passed, she gave her
                husband no rest till he promised to get her some more. So again in the evening twilight he climbed the wall, but
                as he slid down into the garden on the other side he was terribly alarmed at seeing the witch standing near him.
                "How came you here ?" she said with a fierce look. "You have climbed over the wall into my garden like a thief
                and stolen my lettuces ; you shall pay dearly for this. "</p>
        
            <p class="text">"Ah !" replied the poor man, "let me entreat for mercy, I have only taken it in a case of extreme
                need. My wife has seen your lettuces from her window, and she wished for them so much that she said she should
                die if she could not have some of them to eat."</p>
        
            <p class="text">Then the witch's anger cooled a little, and she replied, " If what you tell me is true, then I will
                give you full permission to take as many lettuces as you like, on one condition. You must give up to me the
                child which your wife may bring into the world. I will be very kind to it, and be as careful of it as a mother
                could be."</p>
        
            <p class="text">The husband in his alarm promised every thing the witch asked, and took away with him as many
                lettuces as his wife wanted. Not many weeks after this the wife became the mother of a beautiful little girl,
                and in a short time the witch appeared and claimed her, according to the husband's promise. Thus they were
                obliged to give up the child, which she took away with her directly and gave her the name of Letitia, but she
                was always called Lettice, after the name of the vegetable which grew in the garden.</p>
        
            <p class="text">as she reached the age of twelve years, the witch locked her up in a tower that stood in a forest,
                and this tower had no steps, nor any entrance, excepting a little window. When the witch wished to visit
                Lettice, she would place herself under this window and sing : " Lettice, Lettice, let down your hair, That I may
                climb without a stair. "</p>
        
            <p class="text">Lettice had most long and beautiful hair like spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the witch,
                she would unbind her golden locks, and let them fall loose over the window-sill, from which they hung down to
                such a length that the witch could draw herself up by them into the tower.</p>
        
            <p class="text">herself up by them into the tower. Two years passed in this manner, when it happened one day that
                the king's son rode through the forest. While passing near the tower, he heard such a lovely song and could not
                help stopping to listen. It was Lettice who tried to lighten her solitude by the sound of her own sweet voice.
            </p>
        
            <p class="text">The king's son was very eager to obtain a glimpse of the singer, but he sought in vain for a door to
                the tower ; there was not one to be found. So he rode home, but the song had made such an impression on his
                heart that he went daily into the forest to listen. Once while he stood behind a tree, he saw the witch approach
                the tower and heard her say, â€” Presently he saw a quantity of long golden hair hanging down low over the
                window-sill, and the witch climbing up by it. "Oh !" said the young prince, " if that is the ladder on which
                persons can mount and enter, I will take the first opportunity of trying my luck that way." So on the following
                day, as it began to grow dark, he placed himself under the window and cried,</p>
        
            <p class="text">Immediately the hair fell over the window, and the young prince quickly climbed up and entered the
                room where the young maiden lived Lettice was dreadfully frightened at seeing a strange man come into the room
                through the window ; but the king's son looked at her with such friendly eyes, and began to converse with her so
                kindly, that she soon lost all fear.</p>
        
            <p class="text">He told her that he had heard her singing, and that her song had excited such deep emotion in his
                heart that he could not rest till he had seen her. On hearing this, Lettice ceased to fear him, and they talked
                together for some time, till at length the prince asked her if she would take him for a husband. For a time she
                hesitated, although she saw that he was young and handsome, and he had told her he was a prince.</p>
        
            <p class="text">At last she said to herself, "He will certainly love me better than old Mother Grethel does." So she
                placed her hand in his, and said, " I would willingly go with you, and be your wife ; but I do not know in the
                least how to get away from this place. Unless," she said, after a pause, you will bring me every day some strong
                silk cord, then I will weave a ladder of it, and when it is finished I will descend upon it, and you shall take
                me away on your horse."</p>
        
            <p class="text">The prince readily agreed to this, and promised to come and see her every evening till the ladder
                was finished, for the old witch always came in the day time. The witch had never seen the prince ; she knew
                nothing of hisvisits ; till one day Lettice said innocently, " I shall not have such a heavy weight as you to
                draw up much longer, Mother Grethel, for the king's son is coming very soon to fetch me away." 63 You wicked
                child," cried the witch, " what do I hear you say?</p>
        
            <p class="text">I thought I had hidden you from all the world, and now you have betrayed me. " In her wrath she
                caught hold of Lettice's beautiful hair, and struck her several times with her left hand. Then she seized a pair
                of scissors and cut Lettice's hair, while the beautiful locks, glistening like gold, fell on the ground. And she
                was so hard-hearted after this that she dragged poor Lettice out into the forest, to a wild and desert place,
                and left her there in sorrow and woe.</p>
        
            <p class="text">On the same day on which the poor maiden had been exiled, the witch tied the locks of hair which she
                had cut off poor Lettice's golden head into a kind of tail, and hung it over the window-sill. In the evening,
                the prince came and cried-</p>
        
            <p class="text">Then the witch let the hair down, and the king's son climbed up ; but at the open window he found
                not his dear Lettice, but a wicked witch, who looked at him with cruel and malicious eyes. " Ah !" she cried,
                with a sneer, " you are come to fetch your loving bride, I suppose ; but the beautiful bird has flown from the
                nest, and will never sing any more. The cat has fetched it away, and she intends also to scratch your eyes out.
                To thee is Lettice lost ; thou wilt never behold her again."</p>
        
            <p class="text">The prince felt almost out of his mind with grief as he heard this, and in his despair he sprung out
                of the tower window and fell among the thorns and brambles beneath. He certainly escaped with his life, but the
                thorns stuck into his eyes and blinded them. After this he wandered about the wood for days, eating only wild
                roots and berries, and did nothing but lament and weep for the loss of his beloved bride.</p>
        
            <p class="text">So wandered he for a whole year in misery, till at last he came upon the desert place where Lettice
                had been banished and lived in her sorrow. As he drew near he heard a voice which he seemed to recognise, and
                advancing towards the sound came within sight of Lettice, who recognised him at once with tears. Two of her
                tears fell on his eyes, and so healed and cleared them of the injury done by the thorns that he could soon see
                as well as ever. Then he travelled with her to his kingdom, and she became his wife, and the remainder of their
                days were spent in happiness and content.</p>
